##  Hey! I'm Tariq 👋

I am new to software development with high aspirations. I'm currently improving my skillset in Full Stack development - mainly back-end but I love front-end development as well!

## A Little Bit About Me 👀
My interests are...

🖥️ Coding - I love working on projects and improving my current skillset. Enjoy working with Django and JavaScript!

🎮 Gaming - My favourite type of games are competitive FPS games like COD and CS. I also love RPGs like Elden Ring and Dark Souls.

🏋️ Gym - In my free time if I'm not coding or gaming I enjoy going to the gym and playing football.

💡 Currently learning - PHP and MySQL. Look out for my future projects!
